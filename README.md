## Setup

Install `gulp` globally and all dependencies.

* `$ npm install gulp -g`
* `$ npm install`

## Building

* `$ gulp build` Builds all webpacked projects in `./client/*` -- right now, only `./client/inspector`. Should add `gulp build {tool}` later.

* `$ gulp watch` Watches the file system for changes and calls build when that happens.
